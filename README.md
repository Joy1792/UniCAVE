The Uni-CAVE Plugin is a solution for running Unity within immersive projection VR display systems. 
 
See the documentation in the root folder of the repository for installation of the plugin.

The plugin has been tested on Unity versions 5.4.0f3 and 5.5.0f3  

We are currently taking requests for developing custom prefabs meant to work with your immersive projection setup, or feel free to try yourself by taking a look at the examples within the "ExampleScenes" folder and following the guide in this documentation or on the website.
