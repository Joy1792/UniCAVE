# Contents

The Uni-CAVE Plugin is a solution for running Unity within immersive projection VR display systems. 
 
See the documentation in the root folder of the repository for installation of the plugin.

The plugin has been tested on Unity versions 5.4.0f3 and 5.5.0f3  

We are currently taking requests for developing custom prefabs meant to work with your immersive projection setup, or feel free to try yourself by taking a look at the examples within the "ExampleScenes" folder and following the guide in this documentation or on the website.

2/4/2019 - Support for Unity 2018 has been added.  Note: testing has occurred only on Unity 2018.3.  There have been other streamlining of the process of setting up prefabs, amongst other improvements.  See the documentation on the unicave.discovery.wisc.edu website.

9/30/2017 - We've added separate Unity 2017 and Unity 5.5 versions.  Also, a great deal of UI and other features and enhancements have been added by way of contributions made by the Idaho National Laboratory!

8/9/2017 - We have added the Kinect integration assets and code that appeared to be missing.  Work is also in progress on Unity 2017 support.

5/17/2017 - We have separated out the example scenes into a separate repository : https://github.com/livingenvironmentslab/UniCAVE_Examples to reduce the size of the repository when downloading.
